# Maker

Run commands from your **Makefile** selecting them from menu.

<!-- Image showing Maker in action -->

## Install

To use this tool, you need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/).

```
sudo npm install -g @nex_otaku/maker
```

## Run!

```
cd projects/my-cool-project
maker
```

## How it works

- Reads your Makefile in current directory
- Lists commands from Makefile in a nice menu

## Features

- Comment before a command is displayed as command name
- First mega feature
- Second mega feature
- Third mega feature

## Example Makefile
```bash
# Build app
build:
    ./bin/build.sh

# Run tests
test:
    ./vendor/bin/phpunit

# Deploy to production
deploy:
    ./bin/deploy.sh
```
<!--
## Options

Option | Description
--- | ---
**-d, --directory** | Apply command only to directories
**-f, --file** | Apply command only to files
**-r, --recursive** | Search recursively
**--include-dot-directories** | Look inside directories with names started with dot - ".git", ".idea" etc. Ignoring these directories by default.
**--include-directories-ignored-by-git** | Do not use ".gitignore" rules. By default we skip all directories mentioned in ".gitignore".
-->

## To Be Done

 - Mark command as "Favorite"
 - Hide command from list
 - Nice example Makefile in README
 - Screenshot showing Maker in action
